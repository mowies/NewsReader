# NewsReader
A NNTP-Reader for Android, currently in early development state

Newsreader is a simple NNTP client for Android. Articles from subscribed newsgroups are saved into a local database, synchronization with the news server happens completely in the background, thus there is no delay displaying messages, data- and battery consumption is not too high and it’s possible to read all downloaded messages offline. Memory consumption is larger but it’s only text, and the header data has to be saved anyway in order to mark new messages as unread.

## Features: 
- [x] Unencrypted connection to news servers
- [x] Background synchronization, interval can be configured by user
- [x] Displaying messages chronologically
- [x] Showing message headers
- [x] Displaying number of new messages per newsgroup
- [x] Mark messages as read / unread
- [x] Post messages
- [x] Synchronize only over wifi or always
- [x] Displaying messages hierarchically
- [ ] Individual settings for saving messages
- [ ] Secure password storage on the device
- [ ] Connect to news servers over SSL (if supported) -> not sure yet..
